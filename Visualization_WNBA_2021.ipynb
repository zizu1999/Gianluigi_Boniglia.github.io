On the x-axis, there is the x-coordinate defined as 'Horizontal location in feet of shot attempt where the hoop would be located at 25 feet', and on the y-axis, there is the count of shots. I created this first graph to show in which area, relative to the x-axis, players take more shots, it shows how most of the shots are taken from the central part of the field (based on the x-axis). The second graph is a scatter plot where the x-axis contains the previously defined x-coordinate and the y-axis contains the y-coordinate defined as 'Vertical location in feet of shot attempt with respect to the target hoop'. I created this graph to show in which areas of the court players shoot more frequently, this graph shows how most of the shots taken are either under the rim or near the three-point line."

    "This approach attempts to get the maximum score recorded in each minute. The assumption here is that if there are multiple entries within a minute, the largest value is likely the most up-to-date score. The strengths is It might be slightly more accurate than just taking the first score if score increments are frequently recorded. The weaknesses is The max() aggregation isn't a perfectly reliable way to get an accurate score. It will not correctly show a decrease in score if a score was, for example, reversed. It still might not accurately represent the cumulative score at the end of each minute if scores are frequently being updated."
